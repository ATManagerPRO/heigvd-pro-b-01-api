# About ATManager

Another Task Manager is an Android application dedicated to the management of several to-do lists. The user is able to create different lists and tasks, and to manage them, notifications will remind the user of upcoming deadlines and the user is able to use different views (one day, one week, one month, etc...) to keep track of his tasks. One of the main focuses is the multi-users aspect : list sharing and administratives permissions of different users on the same list.

## The API
This repository is about the ATManager API. We created this API with the PHP MVC web framework [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).

This API was made to be able to manage securely all resources from the database. Then, we can also have many type of client as we want, all of them
will be able to use the same API, this is more efficient, secure and modular.

## Documentation 
We used [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) to create our API documentation that you can found [here](https://atmanager.gollgot.app/swagger/).
